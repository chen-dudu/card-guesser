# card-guesser
This repository contians all the source code for COMP30020-Decalarative Programming project 1.
## Overview
For this project, you will implement a two-player logical guessing game. Two players face each
other, each with a complete standard deck of western playing cards (without jokers). One
player will be the answerer and the other is the guesser. The answerer begins by selecting
some number of cards from his or her deck without showing the guesser. These cards will
form the answer for this game. The aim of the game is for the guesser to guess the answer.
